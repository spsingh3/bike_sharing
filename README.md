## Technologies Used
- numpy 
- pandas 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn 
- statsmodels
- sklearn 
- scipy 



## Conclusions
- ##### cnt =  0.0750 +  0.2331 x yr +  0.0561 x workingday + 0.5499 x temp - 0.1552 x windspeed +  0.0886 x season_summer  +  0.1307 x season_winter  +  0.0974 x mnth_Sep  +  0.0675 x weekday_Mon -0.0800 x weathersit_mist -0.2871 x weathersit_snow  
- ##### So as per the model demand of bikes depend on year, working day, temp, windspeed, summer season, winter season , september mnth,weekday Mon, weather Misty and snow
